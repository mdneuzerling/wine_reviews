    read_csv %>% 
    mutate(variety = variety %>% tolower)
```

## Incomplete data

From the data viusalisation below, we can see that the price data for the wine
is incomplete. Approximately `r round(100 * prop_miss(wine$price))`% of the 
price values are missing. The other missing values are actually empty strings.
Interestingly, a data frame doesn't treat these as missing by default, but a 
tibble does.

```{r vis_dat, cache = TRUE}
wine %>% sample_n(30000) %>% vis_dat
```

We might be tempted to say that the rest of our data is complete. However, many
values are empty strings. If we replace these empty strings with `NA`, we can
see how incomplete the data really is. Fortunately, not all of these variables
will be useful in predicting wine quality (for example, `taster_twitter_handle`).

## Grape colours

Import the colours:

```{r grape_colours, message = FALSE}
varieties <- "varieties.csv" %>% 
    read_csv %>% 
    select(variety, colour)
```    

Now join the colours with the wine data. If there are any missing values, we can
attempt to fill them in based on obvious clues in the variety (eg. a "Red blend"
can safely be assumed to be a red wine).

```{r}
wine <- wine %>% merge(
    varieties %>% select(variety, colour),
    by = "variety",
    all = TRUE
) %>% 
    mutate(
        colour = case_when(
            !is.na(colour) ~ colour,
            grepl("red", variety, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "red",
            grepl("white", variety, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "white"
        )
    )

wine %>% 
    count(colour) %>% 
    knitr::kable(format = "html") %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

## Points
```{r points}
wine %>% ggplot(aes(x = points)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = nrow(wine %>% distinct(points)))
```

## Text analysis

Each wine is accompanied by a single-paragraph review. Using the tidytext 
package we can investigate word and n-gram frequency of these reviews. We first
break down the review into single words.

```{r cache = TRUE}
wine_words <- wine %>% 
    unnest_tokens(word, description) %>% 
    anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>% 
    filter(word != "wine")
```

We can now generate a simple plot of the ten most commonly occurring words. Some
words, such as "the" and "a", occur frequently and serve only a grammatical
purpose, and so are excluded. We also exclude the word "wine", since the presence
of this word doesn't tell us much about the review.

```{r}
wine_words %>%
    count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
    head(20) %>%
    mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
    geom_col(fill = "maroon4") +
    xlab(NULL) +
    theme(text = element_text(size=16)) +
    coord_flip()
```

I'm not sure what purpose word clouds serve, but they seem mandatory at this
point.

```{r}
wine_words %>%
  count(word) %>%
  with(wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 100))
```

An n-gram is a tuple of words appearing sequentially in order within an 
utterance. For example, in the utterance "My name is Fred", "is Fred" is a 
2-gram and "name is Fred" is a 3-gram. A word could also be considered as a
1-gram. Below we define the 2-grams (bigrams) and 3-grams (trigrams) of the wine 
descriptions. 

Along with the `ngram` column, the `separate` column provides us
with separate columns for each word in the n-gram. The column names for these
words are dynamically generated in the `wine_ngrams` helper function, which
provides outputs a tibble of n-grams for a given n. We then use these new
word columns to filter out the stop words, although this time we include n-grams
with the word "wine".

```{r cache = TRUE}
wine_ngrams <- function(n) {
    wine %>%  
        unnest_tokens(ngram, description, token = "ngrams", n = n) %>% 
        separate(
            ngram, 
            sapply(1:n, function(x) {paste0("word", x)}), # eg, "word1", "word2" 
            sep = " ",
            remove = FALSE # keep the n-gram in the tibble
        )
}

wine_2grams <- wine_ngrams(2) %>% 
    filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
    filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)
wine_3grams <- wine_ngrams(3) %>% 
    filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
    filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word) %>% 
    filter(!word3 %in% stop_words$word)
```

There are `r nrow(wine_2grams)` 2-grams, taking up around 
`r round(as.numeric(object.size(wine_2grams)) / 1024^2)` megabytes of memory, 
and `r nrow(wine_3grams)` 3-grams, taking up around 
`r round(as.numeric(object.size(wine_3grams)) / 1024^2)` megabytes. The drop in
number and size is due to the filtering of the stop words.

We can also plot the frequency of the 2- and 3-grams:

```{r}
plot_ngram_frequency <- function(x) {
    get(paste0("wine_", x, "grams")) %>%
        count(ngram, sort = TRUE) %>%
        head(20) %>%
        mutate(ngram = reorder(ngram, n)) %>%
        ggplot(aes(ngram, n)) +
        geom_col(fill = "maroon4") +
        xlab(NULL) +
        theme(text = element_text(size=16)) +
        coord_flip() + 
        ggtitle(paste0("Frequency of ", x, "-grams"))
}

plot_ngram_frequency(2)
plot_ngram_frequency(3)
```
